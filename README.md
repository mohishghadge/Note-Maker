Note Maker Application
This project is a simple Note Maker application that allows users to create, save, and delete notes. The notes are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

Features
Add Note: Click the "Add Note" button to create a new note.
Save Note: Save notes automatically when you click outside the textarea or manually by clicking the save icon.
Delete Note: Delete notes with a smooth drop-down animation by clicking the trash icon.
Persistent Storage: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage.
Animations: Smooth animations for adding and deleting notes, and rotating the add button icon on hover.
Demo
Include a screenshot or link to a demo of the application if available.
